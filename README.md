# Zen Engine

A game engine made in C, it should be cross-platform in the future, I'm actually focusing Linux support first

Zen Engine is in **very early development**, you can check the [project](https://github.com/Hyphona/Zen-Engine/projects) page to see what I'm currently working on

Yet, 99% of what you see in the codebase is not definitive (I'm sure I will learn a lot of new things)
