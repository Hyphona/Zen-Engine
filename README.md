# 🕹️ Zen Engine

**Zen Engine** aims to be an easy to use cross-platform game engine wrote in C, currently in **very early development** you can check the [project](https://github.com/Hyphona/Zen-Engine/projects) page to see what I'm currently working on

I code by respecting the 42 standard available [here](https://github.com/42school/norminette/tree/master/pdf), which include as example:

- No more than 25 lines per function
- A function can takes at most 4 named parameters
- A line can't be more than 80 columns long
- A variable should not be declared and initialised on the same line
- Not allowed to use ```for```, ```do...while```, ```switch```, ```case```, ```go to``` 

> [!NOTE]
> Yet, 99% of what you see in the codebase is not definitive (I'm sure I will learn a lot of new things with this project)
> 
> A documentation will be provided when the project will be mature enough, pull requests will be welcome as well
