# 🕹️ Zen Engine

**Zen Engine** aims to be an easy to use cross-platform game engine wrote in C, currently in **very early development** you can check the [project](https://github.com/Hyphona/Zen-Engine/projects) page to see what I'm currently working on

> [!NOTE]
> Yet, 99% of what you see in the codebase is not definitive (I'm sure I will learn a lot of new things with this project)
> 
> A documentation will be provided when the project will be mature enough, pull requests will be welcome as well
